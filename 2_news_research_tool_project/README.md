## Features

- Load URLs or upload text files containing URLs to fetch article content.
- Process article content through LangChain's UnstructuredURL Loader
- Construct an embedding vector using OpenAI's embeddings and leverage FAISS, a powerful similarity search library, to enable swift and effective retrieval of relevant information
- Interact with the LLM's (Chatgpt) by inputting queries and receiving answers along with source URLs.


2.The web app will open in your browser.

- On the sidebar, you can input URLs directly.

- Initiate the data loading and processing by clicking "Process URLs."

- Observe the system as it performs text splitting, generates embedding vectors, and efficiently indexes them using FAISS.

- The embeddings will be stored and indexed using FAISS, enhancing retrieval speed.

- The FAISS index will be saved in a local file path in pickle format for future use.
- One can now ask a question and get the answer based on those news articles
